# ZW MCP Ecosystem: AI-Powered Creative Orchestration

![ZW MCP System Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=ZW+MCP+System+Architecture)
*A unified framework for AI-assisted content creation, 3D modeling, and narrative generation*

## Overview

ZW MCP is an advanced ecosystem that bridges AI-powered language models with creative tools through the ZW protocol - a structured format for describing scenes, animations, and narratives. This system enables:

- üß† **AI-assisted creation** using Ollama language models
- üé® **Procedural 3D content generation** in Blender
- ü§ñ **Multi-agent collaboration** for complex tasks
- üîÑ **Roundtrip workflows** between text and 3D environments
- ‚ö° **Real-time networked communication** between components

A key component in this ecosystem is **EngAIn-Orbit (`tools/engain_orbit.py`)**, which processes `.zwx` files.
The `.zwx` format separates `ZW-INTENT` (the semantic directive, e.g., target system and function)
from `ZW-PAYLOAD` (the actual ZW data for the creative task). This allows for clear,
AI-dispatchable instructions and modular routing to different backend engines.

```python

## Tools and Utilities

### `tools/engain_orbit.py`: ZWX Execution Router
The `engain_orbit.py` script (located in the `tools/` directory) is the primary entry point for executing `.zwx` files.
Key aspects of this system include:
- **`.zwx` File Format**: Combines a `ZW-INTENT` block (metadata for routing and execution) with a `ZW-PAYLOAD` block (the ZW commands).
  ```
  ZW-INTENT:
    TARGET_SYSTEM: blender
    TARGET_FUNCTION: create_scene
    DESCRIPTION: A simple cube
  ---
  ZW-PAYLOAD:
    OBJECT: MyCube
      TYPE: Cube
      SIZE: 2
  ```
- **Schema Validation**: The `ZW-INTENT` block is automatically validated by `tools/intent_utils.py` to ensure required fields like `TARGET_SYSTEM` are present, aiding in early error detection and debugging of `.zwx` files.
- **Execution Logging**: All routing attempts, successes, and failures (including validation errors) by `engain_orbit.py` are logged with timestamps to `zw_mcp/logs/orbit_exec.log`. This provides a detailed audit trail for diagnostics. Example:
  ```log
  [2023-10-27 10:00:00] ‚úî Routed: examples/my_scene.zwx ‚Üí blender
  [2023-10-27 10:00:05] ‚ùå Validation FAILED: examples/bad_scene.zwx - Missing TARGET_SYSTEM in ZW-INTENT block.
  ```

### `tools/orbit_watchdog.py`: Automated ZWX File Processor

The `orbit_watchdog.py` script provides an automated way to process `.zwx` files.
It monitors a specified directory for new `.zwx` files, and upon detection,
it uses `engain_orbit.py` to validate and route them.

**Key Features:**
- **Automated Processing**: Continuously watches a folder for new files.
- **Uses EngAIn-Orbit**: Leverages `engain_orbit.py` for the core processing logic (validation, routing).
- **File Management**: Moves processed files to designated subfolders (`executed/` for successes, `failed/` for failures).
- **Logging**: Records its activities, including files processed and outcomes, to `zw_mcp/logs/orbit_watchdog.log`.
- **Single Run Mode**: Supports a `--once` flag to scan the folder once and then exit.

**Directory Structure:**
The watchdog expects the following directory structure (relative to the project root):
- `zw_drop_folder/validated_patterns/`: The directory monitored for new `.zwx` files.
- `zw_drop_folder/executed/`: Successfully processed files are moved here.
- `zw_drop_folder/failed/`: Files that failed processing are moved here.

Ensure these directories are created before running the watchdog, or the script will attempt to create them.

**Usage:**
To run the watchdog continuously:
```bash
python3 tools/orbit_watchdog.py
```
To scan the folder once and exit:
```bash
python3 tools/orbit_watchdog.py --once
```

## Testing and Validation

This project includes a test suite to verify the functionality of the ZWX intent-routing pipeline.

### Automated Test Suite

The primary test runner is `tools/test_orbit_routing.py`. It automatically discovers and executes `.zwx` test files located in the `zwx-test-suite/` directory.

**Running the Suite:**
To execute all tests:
```bash
python3 tools/test_orbit_routing.py
```
The script will print a summary of test results to the console, indicating total tests, expected passes/fails, and actual passes/fails.

**Interpreting Results:**
- Test files in `zwx-test-suite/` prefixed with `invalid_` (e.g., `invalid_missing_target.zwx`) are expected to cause an error during processing by `engain_orbit.py` (i.e., `engain_orbit.py` should exit with a non-zero status code). The test runner counts this as a **test pass** if the error occurs as expected.
- All other test files are expected to be processed successfully by `engain_orbit.py` (i.e., exit with a zero status code).

**Test Logs:**
Detailed logs for each test run, including the command output and specific errors for failed tests, are written to:
`zw_mcp/logs/orbit_test_results.log`

### Manual Testing with Watchdog

You can also perform manual or simulation testing using the `orbit_watchdog.py` tool:
1. Ensure `tools/orbit_watchdog.py` is running (either continuously or with the `--once` flag).
   ```bash
   python3 tools/orbit_watchdog.py
   ```
2. Copy or create `.zwx` files in the `zw_drop_folder/validated_patterns/` directory.
3. The watchdog will automatically pick up these files, process them via `engain_orbit.py`, and move them to `zw_drop_folder/executed/` or `zw_drop_folder/failed/`.
4. Review `zw_mcp/logs/orbit_watchdog.log` for processing details and `zw_mcp/logs/orbit_exec.log` for `engain_orbit.py` execution details.

This approach helps simulate production ingestion and validate the end-to-end automated workflow.
